# Blog for the 21 of September

**Attending:**

1. Fredrika (Secretary)
2. Samuel
3. Mirko
4. Pontus

**The Afternoon**:

Because of some errors from last time the first thing we have to do is either a new migration to our database or delete our existing and create a new. 

We started out with a new migration, but it took a while for our database to deploy so we couldn't try a update.

We went on to look at the structure. Last time we created a repository and controller named ParkingGuard[...], but perhaps the existing methods and logic in this class could be moved into a ParkingLot controller/repository. We want our project to follow the structure of our earlier projects where each model had a repository and controller. 

We decided to divide the models and classes between each other, this will save some time. The generic repository was copy-pasted from one of Samuels earlier project into our project to save even more time. We erased some of the existing generic methods because they felt a bit unnecessary for our project.

 *" Now time for a 15 minute break;*

We divided the models as follows: 

1. Person -> Fredrika
2. Starship -> Pontus
3. Parkinglot -> Mirko
4. Frontend -> Samuel
