**The Afternoon**:

We started to discuss what to do next in the project.

We're looking into how to park a ship. Now that we have the functionality for saving a person to the Database. 

Right now we're going to work on posting a starship to the database from the frontend.

We managed to fix the starship posting along with coming a long way on making a put request on parkinglot.
