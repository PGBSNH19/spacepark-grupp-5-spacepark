##### Day 1: Tuesday, 15 September. 

The morning started with us taking a trip down memory lane, aka looking at our previous projects from the"Data√•tkomster i .NET"-course. We did some more planning, decided on some classes that we would need. 

We all felt a bit rusty skill wise and had some questions about the project and so on. So we decided that we all needed to read some more and wait until after tomorrows lecture to actually start doing more.
