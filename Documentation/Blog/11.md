**The Morning:**

After 9 hours yesterday night, Sam managed to refactor a lot of different files among those including site.js and all of the repositories. By 3 am the code for handling the API calls from frontend to backend was mostly finished.

In the morning we refactored even more together and made needed changes to the code especially to the site.js.

Some more changes was made but to see them all you can look at these pull requests:

We started to do the logging and Applications Insight. 

Right now we are putting up docker support. 
Making images of the projects and containers that we will add to containerregistry and two ACI:s to allow Continouos Deployment.

We started checking out how to get tests to run on our build pipeline. It doesn't seem to find our tests when it runs the build pipeline.

Goals for tommorow is to get the ACI:s up and running, connected to release pipelines and get tests to run. And make sure Application Insights works as it should.
