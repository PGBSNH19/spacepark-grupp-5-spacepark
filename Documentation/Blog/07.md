# Blog for the 23 of September

**Attending:**

1. Fredrika
2. Samuel
3. Mirko
4. Pontus (Secretary)

**The Afternoon:**

We gathered and worked together on the frontend. We have begun connecting the frontend and backend. We tried some POST and GET requests to our API that saves the data in the cloud database. When we tried POST in JavaScript from the frontend to the backend we have some trouble sending the POST to the backend.
