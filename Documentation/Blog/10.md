**The Morning:**

This day started on a good mood and i was going to write the code. But the CORS HAPPEND and we didn't want to waste time on it so Samuel took over the code writing :(.



It didnt work as well on Samuels Computer so we wanted to get started so we decided that Fredrika Should be driver because it worked on her computer.



We decided that our Starship should have a ParkingLotID

We started creating methods for putting spaceships.

It is not going so good today, it felt yesterday as we didnt have so much left to do, but haha on us. Everything is messing with us!
