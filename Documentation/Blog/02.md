We came to the decision to go with using the RazorPages project structure and we will build upon this in the later stages of the production. Then we started going through the structure of the database and the tables using CRC-cards. We created the models for "ParkingLot", "Person", "Spaceship". We discussed the ParkingGuard logic but did not come to a conclusion on it just yet, we will come back to it later.

Started writing the APICaller code for the get request for the Star Wars API and made the first unit test for one method.
