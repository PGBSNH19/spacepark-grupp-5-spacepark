#### Planering, dag 1: 

Create the repo on GitHub, set up pipeline, create the project.

Do some planning and add folder for blog. 

##### Planning, day 2:

Things that has to exist in the project: 

***Register parkings in database***: Should only active parkings be visible in the database, or should we save all visitors in the database?

***Api (swapi)***: control that every visitor is a known starwars character, this could be done by the ParkingGuard-class?
***Some sort of payment***: the visitor should get some sort of invoice when they leave the Spaceport. This could be very simple? Perhaps just a console.writeline with your information. The invoice should be saved in the database.
